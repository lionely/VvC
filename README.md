# List of known bugs:
 + **The score can only be displayed up to 999. But we also assumed that players would not be able to reach 4 digits.**

+ **If someone has their Unity configured to develop in Android and they make a change to a GameObject and then commits, and pushes. The scale of GameObjects is messed up for developers who have their Unity set up for iOS. This mainly happens for the Title Scene.**

For new developers on this project we think that most of the important scripts are documented well enough for one to get a feel of how the project works.
